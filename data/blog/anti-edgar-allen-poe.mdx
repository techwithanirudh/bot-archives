Depending on who is reading his work, Edgar Allen Poe can be seen as a controversial author. His works span many different genres, but often include elements of horror and the macabre that could be disturbing to some people. His stories contain dark symbols and various metaphors which may be difficult for some to understand. Additionally, the stories tend to be associated with the gothic genre, leaving out potential readers that don't find this appealing.

For those readers who understand his use of symbolism and comprehend the meaning in his work, they may find it to be interesting or even exciting. Poe’s admirers often view his works as poetic pieces of art as he incorporates graphical illustrations when painting the scenes. Furthermore, they are written in a very specific fashion in regards to rhythm and structure which is viewed with appreciation by some readers.

On the other hand, readers that don’t appreciate or understand this use or structure of writing might dislike this aspect of Edgar Allan Poe’s work as it can make them feel excluded from readily understanding its content. Not all of Poe's work includes these elements either; he wrote about many topics such as politics, family relationships and science fiction – but much of them focus on emotion and darkness.

Poe also often sheds light on how he felt about himself; in ‘The Raven’ Poe seems to use themes such as depression and death in order to express himself through his writing, however some may not appreciate this method of storytelling – preferring more traditional approaches when it comes to literature. Another point for those considering reading Poe would be that certain age groups may not appreciate his material due to its intensity or ancient language - depending on their level of understanding.

Finally, although Edgar Allen Poe is considered one of America's first influential gothic writers, some may view him negatively due to his exploration into death-related topics and publishing works on gruesome murder scenarios - potentially causing distress for those unfamiliar with such content. Thus there are multiple reasons as to why one may want avoid reading Edgar Allen Poe's works depending on their expectations from literature and individual tastes in topics being discussed within them.
