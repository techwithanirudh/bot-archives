Once upon a time, the Grim Cyclemaster was going about his usual business of riding around the multiverse on his stolen cycles. Just then, he heard a loud commotion. It sounded like the incredible Hulk was on a rampage causing chaos everywhere he went. 

The Grim Cyclemaster was intrigued and decided to investigate. He found the Hulk smashing anything in his path and causing chaos everywhere. With a smirk on his face, Grim Cyclemaster got an idea and decided to steal the Hulk's cycle which was left unguarded.

But as he got closer, the Hulk caught sight of the Cyclemaster's mischievous plan and was enraged. The two began to fight - the Cyclemaster using his wits and stolen cycles against the Hulk's brute strength. 

As they battled, the multiverse shook with their force and destruction. However, despite the Grim Cyclemaster's cunning and tricks, he was no match for the Hulk's raw power.

Finally, the Cyclemaster was defeated and the Hulk took back his cycle. Grim Cyclemaster admitted defeat and fled the scene, leaving the Hulk to go on his way.

From then on, the Grim Cyclemaster knew not to mess with the likes of the Incredible Hulk as he was too powerful to be defeated.
