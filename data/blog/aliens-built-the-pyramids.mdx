Aliens building the pyramids is a controversial topic that has been debated for centuries. While some believe that aliens were responsible for the construction of the pyramids, others argue that ancient Egyptians were the ones who built them.

The evidence for aliens building the pyramids is largely circumstantial. For example, some point to the fact that the stones used to build the pyramids are too large and heavy to have been moved by humans. Additionally, some suggest that certain features of the pyramids, such as their perfect alignment with cardinal directions, could not have been achieved without advanced technology.

On the other hand, there is also evidence to suggest that ancient Egyptians were responsible for building the pyramids. For instance, there are hieroglyphs found inside of some of them which indicate that they were built by humans. Additionally, archaeologists have uncovered tools and other artifacts which suggest that ancient Egyptians had access to technology capable of constructing such structures.

Ultimately, it is impossible to definitively prove or disprove either side of this debate. However, it is clear that both sides have compelling arguments and evidence in support of their claims. Therefore, it is up to each individual to decide which theory they believe is more likely true based on their own research and analysis.
